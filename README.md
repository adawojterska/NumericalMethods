# Numerical Methods

This repository contains project files for the **"Numerical Methods"** course during the third term at the Warsaw University of Technology (winter 2024/2025). The course focused on numerical techniques for solving mathematical problems. The projects were implemented using **MATLAB**. This repository includes 2 individual projects:

## 1. Newton's method for finding roots of polynomials
The first project focuses on finding the roots of polynomials using **Newton's Method**. The polynomial is given by:

$w(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k x^k$

The project compares the **convergence speed** of Newton's method when applied to polynomials with simple and double roots. The method's efficiency and accuracy are analyzed in relation to these two types of roots.  

## 2. Solving Linear Systems with the SOR Method
The second project focuses on solving a system of linear equations $( Ax = b )$, where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, using the **Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)** method. The SOR method is an iterative approach for solving linear systems, which improves upon the Gauss-Seidel method by introducing a relaxation factor $\omega$.
